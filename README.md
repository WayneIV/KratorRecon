# KratorRecon

KratorStrike is a modular, terminal-based recon and exploitation toolkit. Each module saves its results as JSON files inside the `output/` folder and logs actions to `logs/session.log`.

## Usage

Run the launcher:

```bash
python3 kratorstrike.py
```

Select a module from the menu. Results will be stored in the corresponding output subdirectory.
